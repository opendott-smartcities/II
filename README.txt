# II

This folder contains the deliverables related to the second year of PhD research on Smart Cities within the OpenDoTT project (Open Design of Trusted Things). OpenDoTT is a PhD programme from Northumbria University and the Mozilla Foundation funded by the European Union / Horizon 2020 / Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie programme.

During the second year of the [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org) project, I am expected to co-create prototypes of [my research](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott) on waste prevention in smart cities. I have accomplished that centrally through reuse.city, an online co-design lab attended by participants from different countries across the world. Organising the lab itself became an way of cultivating a community of practitioners interested in promoting the reuse of goods and materials in cities and regions.

Other activities that provided data, insights and density to my research this year were training modules on open hardware and privacy; my participation as in conferences and festivals as a speaker as well as audience; prototyping speculative technologies to help augmenting the capacity to assess the potential value of discarded materials. Finally, my own experience of moving to Berlin and learning about how materials are used, discarded and re-used offered a chance to approach the subject from an auto-ethnographic point of view.

Contents of this repository:

- [D10 - Technology demonstrators](D10_technology-demonstrators): experiments and code developed during the training module on open hardware and prototyping.
- [D11 - Co-designed concepts](D11_co-designed-concepts): updated versions of concepts to be prototyped.
- [D12 - Documentation of prototypes](D12_documentation-of-prototypes): experiments to make the concepts concrete and test their relevance and validity.
- [D13 - Deployment datasets](D13_deployment-datasets): data generated whilst developing and implementing the prototypes.
- [D14 - Open Technology Workbooks](D14_open-technology-workbooks): an overview of this year's activities.

As the project moves to its third and final year, I will explore how the ideas developed earlier can make their way into policy and implemented in real-world scenarios.
