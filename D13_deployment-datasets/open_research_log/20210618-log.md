It sometimes feels as though I'm hopping too much between different documentation contexts. I decided to make notes here today, as they are a sort of metadocumentation of what I'm doing elsewhere. And it may be that this repository will the main axis of my documentation for this year's activities.

The core of reuse.city lab took place between April and May. We had a number of calls with discussions and presentations, as well as a couple of surveys to adapt to participants not able to attend the live sessions. There is a lot of documentation about the lab in its own repository.

Last week I have registered the domain thingwiki and set up an instance of [wiki.js](https://js.wiki) using heroku. I see this becoming the prototype of the universal registry of things. This morning I decided to create a first [sample entry](https://thingwiki.herokuapp.com/template/samples), of the plush Unicorn I found in Dundee. I figured working with real objects might bring relevant insight and help me model the database.

I'm also considering the idea of turning my move to a new place next week as a diary study of my own relation with a generous city and what that implies.

On the side, as I read and see references I'm feeling the need to document it in a nonlinear way, as my brain seems to work this way (no kidding?). So I'm setting up yet another wiki where I hope to start building the structure of my thesis. This time, I'll use the subdomain wiki.reuse.city. reuse.city of course might become the core of my PhD, and I need to refactor everything else to fit that perspective. How does this sound?
