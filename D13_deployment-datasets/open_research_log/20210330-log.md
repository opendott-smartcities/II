After giving a little more thought on how best to organise and communicate my research workshops, as well as consulting with colleagues and acquaintances, I'm deciding to:

- set up a simple landing page on the URL make.reuse.city inviting people to sign up for the workshops and other ways to interact
- have the first online workshop/call scheduled for April 9th, [IoT Day](https://www.iotday.org/.)
- decide with the participants what is the best way to interact moving forward. it may be, as I commented here and there, that I need to put an extra effort in mediating between different communication tools and environments. I think that's an honest place to be in.

As I considered which if any of my images to use in the landing page, I received an email from unsplash announcing their being acquired by getty images. That doesn't sound good in the long run, but for the time being things apparently will remain open as they are today, and the whole episode was useful even to remind me of unsplash. I used their album feature to create a collection of images related to repair, workshops and cities, that can be accessed [here](https://unsplash.com/collections/74655758/make-reuse-city).

I spent some hours today on web development. At first experimenting with different CMSs, but I ended up deciding to stick with GRAV. So in the evening I was customising a landing page skeleton, experimenting with images and doing some admin chores. Tomorrow I'll add my own content and hope to start inviting people to check it out and hopefully sign up to my workshop series asap.

Again, the name, with some more flare to it:

**make.reuse.city**
