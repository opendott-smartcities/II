# 2.4 (D13) Deployment Datasets

> This deliverable is an output of T2.4, which involves the deployment of refined prototypes into real world contexts. The dataset will largely comprise ethnographic fieldnotes, interviews, etc.

This folder contains data generated during the second year of PhD research on Smart Cities within the OpenDoTT project (Open Design of Trusted Things). OpenDoTT is a PhD programme from Northumbria University and the Mozilla Foundation funded by the European Union / Horizon 2020 / Marie Skłodowska-Curie programme.

The PhD research focuses on waste prevention through collective practices of reuse, in the form of repair, upcycling and re-circulation. It investigates the confluence of intiatives and policies in themes such as zero waste, circular economy and doughnut economy.

This dataset has the following subfolders:

- [generous_city]: field notes for an upcoming auto-ethnographic account of reuse of materials in Berlin.
- [link-collection]: updated version of bookmarks list collected since the start of the PhD research.
- [open_research_log]: meta-documentation about some of this year's activities.
- [reuse.city]: outputs from the online co-design lab conducted with a group of participants involved with initiatives of repair, upcycling and re-circulation of goods and materials.

The dataset comprises of data collected through these studies and activities, consisting of interviews (in formats PDF and ODF), contents of emails sent to participants, as well as particular images of activities, notes and analyses.
