# reuse.city - meetings

From early April to the first half of May 2021 I have conducted meetings with the participants of reuse.city online co-design lab. More details can be found in the description of [activities](../activities.md). This folder contains all the outputs generated in interactions with participants:

 - [transcription](transcriptions) of meetings and interviews, in PDF format.
 - my [research notes](notes) made during and after the meetings.
 - [images](miro-boards) and [backup in the RTB format](miro-boards/export) of the collaborative whiteboards (made with miro) used to interact with participants and collect information.
 - [final survey - results](reuse city lab - participant feedback on prototypes.csv)
