# reuse.city - activities performed

The reuse.city online co-design lab ran between the first week of April and the second week of May 2021. All activities happened online in a mix of scheduled calls adapting to different timezones, contents sent to participants and other forms of digital interaction.

## Week 1: introductions, definitions

For starters, there was a need to explore what exactly an online co-design lab would be. Lacking the possibility to spend time together on the same locality, digital content would then be used to trigger online interactions both simultaneous and asynchronous so as to fit different profiles of participants. A video introducing the study and posing the question "what a co-design lab should be" was sent early on to the participants, together with a survey about their preferred means of interaction, and an invitation to meet online later in the same week.

It was early noted that the participants would have diverse levels of familiarity with the research topics and with studies developed earlier on this project. In order not to use up time of the calls to provide context, smaller videos presenting different parts of the research - called "fragments" - would then be offered as conversation triggers. The first one was about the choice of research topic (waste prevention and smart cities ).

The date of April 9th was chosen for the first meeting to coincide with the international programme of activities "IoT day" organised by the Internet of Things Council. A group of participants were present on a video call that day to introduce themselves and were exposed to an overview of the research leading to reuse.city. There were discussions about reusing materials in very diverse local contexts - from advanced reuse centres in Finland to community workshops in a refugee camp in Uganda, as well as the limits of technology to provide solutions for waste materials.

## Week 2: in-depth conversations

As the group was composed of people spanning a wide range of timezones (from India to California), different time slots were offered from the second week on. Another video fragment, about design research and the studies developed in the first year, was sent to the participants. They were also offered the opportunity to present their work or ideas about reuse and repair on the following week.

The first meeting had only one participant, and became more of an interview. It allowed for a deep immersion discussing particularities, tools and a systemic take on the reuse of materials. The second meeting had other three participants - two of which had joined the first session on week 1. They discussed structures or social/cultural practices for the reuse of materials participants saw on their local contexts. The idea was to learn about the kind of selection that these structures and practices imply, and whether it could be improved with technologies. Side conversations started to take place on the newly established communication spaces created following the survey sent out the previous week: an email-based discussion list, and a group on Telegram messaging platform.

## Week 3: presentations

Another video fragment was shared with participants, this one about concept ideas created in a previous phase of research. It was a way to prepare the participants to discuss the prototypes towards the end of the lab.

Following the call on the previous week, participants presented diverse projects, an interesting exposition of different whilst complimentary perspectives on reuse. Rhea Muthane shared her experience with a project called "100 ways of mending" and the Makeflix collective. Hugo Pilate has shown his experiments with speculative design of reused objects. Mark Philips reported on his long-term documentary photography covering repair cafes, reuse centres and other contexts in four continents. And finally, Fred Paulino has shown his work with the Gambiologia collective in Brazil exploring the aesthetics of improvisation and reuse. Tom Passmore presented Dsposal, a software solution to make waste compliance easier. A sixth presentation was cancelled due to health impediments.

## Week 4: concepts and prototypes

In tandem with the calls with participants, prototyping was taking place with open hardware and software. As the programmed activities were reaching their end, the focus shifted to gather feedback on the way the concepts were evolving. A closing meeting was scheduled for April 30th, and attended by participants who had been to previous sessions. The group was introduced to updated versions of three prototypes:

- the universal registry of things, with the question whether it should be called "valudata";
- the evaluation interface E-I, taking mainly the shape of a workbench machine that could also be ported to a mobile app or adopt a larger kiosk form factor;
- transformation labs, a blueprint to establish reuse centres furnished with equipment and tools that at some points resembled those in community repair events, but also included others more common to fablabs and makerspaces.

The participants had the chance to discuss each of these prototypes and bring their insights and ideas, as well as contributing to an online collaborative graphic board using the Miro platform.

## Further interactions

Alternative ways to collect feedback from participants who didn't make it to the last meeting were offered right after. Videos about each of the prototypes were shared as conversation triggers. The Miro board was kept open for a period of two weeks and received additional comments. In order to make collaboration easier to participants not familiar with Miro, a survey was also sent out and answered by other two participants.
