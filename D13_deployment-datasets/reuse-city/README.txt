# reuse.city online co-design lab

This folder contains documentation of a research study called "reuse city online co-design lab". The study was created to co-design updated versions of earlier concept ideas with participants familiar with topics of reuse and repair, coming from diverse localities and backgrounds.

The co-design process was created to help shape the work on prototypes based on the concept ideas, as well as to discuss what the implications of such prototypes would be in diverse real-world scenarios.

During a period of about five weeks, a series of activities were performed including synchronous as well as asynchronous conversations via internet; the use of collaborative boards to present ideas and gather contributions; online surveys; and conversations both on social media and in private online environments. The data you can find in this folder are the outputs of such activities, as follows:

 - overview.txt - an overview of the research study.
 - activities.txt activities performed in the lab.
 - ethics - Northumbria University's ethics approval of the study.
 - communication - information exchanged with participants via email, video and an online poll.
