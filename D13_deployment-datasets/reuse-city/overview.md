# reuse.city - study design

## Research questions

reuse.city was created to expand the understanding of the diverse skills and abilities involved with:

 - assessing the potential value of discarded materials.
 - realising that value with the aid of digital tools and technologies, to the benefit of local society.

The study was designed to address the following research questions:

- RQ1: what are the skills involved in the reuse of materials?
  - Can those skills they be augmented and replicated via digital systems?
  - What kind of hardware and software would contribute to make that happen?
- RQ2: what kind of facility can help improve the amount of materials that are reused in cities and regions?
  - Are there relevant experiences in place anywhere in the world that can inspire such systems? How can they be replicated and expanded?

## Ethics

The study was approved by the Northumbria University Ethics system on 16.02.2021 under reference number 28431. More information can be found in [this folder](ethics).

## Recruitment

The participants of reuse city lab were recruited via social media, invited personally by the researcher or suggested by colleagues and other participants. A total of 29 persons from ten different countries in four continents, signed up to the study by filling the consent form. Not all of the people who signed up have ultimately engaged with the lab activities.

## Study methodology

The reuse.city lab approached the research questions from different perspectives:

 - Expanding on some of the original concept ideas developed in the first year of research:
   - The Universal Registry of Things as informational groundwork - a multi-layered database of objects and materials about things and their repairability, spare parts, authorised repair shops, and possibilities for reuse and recycling.
   - Hardware expanding on the original concept called Point and Reuse, taking shape as a machine that identifies objects against the database and displays information about their potential for reuse.
 - Conducting meetings and workshops with participants interested in and/or engaged with the reuse of second-hand goods and materials. Documentation of the meetings was used to create updated concept ideas and to guide prototyping.
 - Prototyping and experimenting with digital technologies to promote the reuse of materials in tandem with a training module on open hardware.

It was also complemented by ongoing auto-ethnographic exploration of reuse in the city of Berlin, looking at how the prototypes could impact on the reuse of materials. Writing and notes from that exploration were part of the dialogue with participants, and have informed prototyping as well. Images of this explorations are found in the [generous city](../generous city) folder.

## Results

At the end of the four weeks of meetings and the short period of collecting further contributions thereafter, updated versions of the concept ideas had been developed and prototypes were started. Extensive notes of the meetings are publicly available on GitHub, as well as the contents created to trigger conversations. Video recordings and transcriptions of the meetings and participants' presentations are to be made available soon enough as well.

As described, initially the lab focused on two of the original concept ideas. The first one, the Universal Registry of Things, which had been slightly refined already in an online workshop during the Mozilla Festival in March. The second was based on a concept idea designed previously called Point and Reuse - an app for mobile devices -, but during the lab was articulated in more general terms as "Evaluation Interface", or E-I. It could still be thought of as a mobile app, but as experiments with prototyping in open hardware were being developed simultaneously, other forms and shapes were discussed and experimented with.

Through the online co-design lab, new concepts based on the original concept ideas were developed. Two of them were turned into prototypes: an experimental implementation of the Universal Registry of Things called ThingWiki, and a demonstration of technologies to enable E-I, in the form of a workbench machine.

Additionally, the conversations with participants suggested it was relevant to work also on a third concept idea not originally planned to be worked on at this stage of research: the transformation labs. As well as experimenting with technologies that would allow interested parties to assess the potential value of discarded materials, the online workshops brought forth also the discussion about what kind of urban facilities is needed to promote the reuse of materials, what were its precedents and relevant references, as well as main desirable characteristics.

The online lab provided the basis for prototyping thingwiki [^thingwiki], the workbench version of E-I, and a draft blueprint of what should be taken into account when planning for urban transformation labs.

Finally, the period of planning, implementing and documenting the lab turned into a community building effort. Notes about insights and impressions about that aspect of reuse.city lab were also made. A great proportion of the participants have shown interested in maintaining the discussion for a longer period, which can be fruitful not only for coming phases of research but also to provide space for future impact on the world.

## Conclusion

Whilst the reuse.city lab was focused on providing density and insight to the prototyping phase, the conversations with participants raised important points for its wider research context as well. When investigating how society can reuse a higher proportion of goods and materials in a local and regional scale, technology and individual behaviour will not be enough.

A growing number of initiatives are stepping up to the challenge of substantially reducing the impact of industrial production. For instance, the cities from all around the world joining the Fabcity network whose aim is that by 2054 they produce everything they consume [REF]. The goal is laudable, but that narrative itself may lead to distortions. If it is only about the manufacturing of new products, important issues such as the demand for new raw materials and the treatment of waste remain outside the discussion boundaries. The ultimate goal of addressing climate change would be greatly improved if reuse was a structural part of such initiatives.

With that context in mind, some conversations resulting of reuse.city lab were particularly relevant. A central point, the importance of physical spaces providing access to tools and equipment, was incorporated in a prototype: the blueprint for transformation labs. It derives from one of the concept ideas created in previous stages of research, which was originally intended to be worked on only on future phases of research. But it was perceived as central to help cities start working on such matters.

The blueprint for the transformation labs was added of real-world references and insight. Even their composition in terms of equipment was part of the feedback gathered from participants. Projects such as the reuse centres in Finland, and how they accept virtually any kind of materials, were also acknowledged.

Another side to the discussion about physical spaces for reuse is that storage is crucial. It is not rare that one unused object of today will be needed tomorrow. Or, conversely, that a broken product needs time to be worked on, to receive spare parts or new parts to be tailored. Storage for works-in-progress as well as to things that can become useful in the future could be understood as a reserve of potential uses, a resource in itself.

The logistics of reuse, additionally, does not depend only on space to keep materials waiting to be reused. Transporting them is another challenge. In some cities, repair shops are not that common and end up being far from one's household or workplace. While that is already annoying with small items, it becomes impractical for larger objects. Some places have, for instance, pop-up and/or mobile repair shops. Other cities have publicly-funded schemes allowing people to borrow cargo bikes so they can move their own stuff around [^flotte-berlin].

Another theme of reflection coming from the meetings with participants has to do with the governance of the Universal Registry of Things. Instead of creating (yet another) centralised database, the conversations suggested the adoption of a distributed approach. Wikipedia was mentioned as a reference of a data asset edited and curated by a diversity of collaborators. While that is obviously an important benchmark - which would afterwards even inspire the naming of the prototype as thingwiki -, there are some remarks to be made.

Wikipedia draws inspiration - indeed it uses as an explicit metaphor - the encyclopaedic ideals. Such an analogy suggests that there is a certain body of knowledge relating to the world, things, beings, ideas and the like. However, that knowledge is encoded into the encyclopaedia by individual humans who must adhere to a particular method. On Wikipedia, the solution to conflicting opinions is always performed at an individual level: humans argumenting against each other. By the same token, content is normally added by individual humans who are ultimately held accountable for it as individuals.

In the case of an Universal Registry of Things, however, the goal would not be generating and maintaining an overarching body of knowledge about everything. Rather, the main concern would be how to access and validate information that is largely spread out on the internet, and constantly changing. Its structure should then welcome alternative methods of validation and maintenance of data, be it through automation (AI, crawlers, bots) as well as via institutional bodies. In fact, the evolution of legislation on the right to repair being proposed and put in practice in different parts of the world could be a good opportunity to establish public bodies responsible for making corporations and other orgnaisations adhere to a hypothetical distributed protocol for data on how to reuse things.

Finally, it must be said that the original intention of not only focusing on a discrete design research exercise but using also the opportunity to create a community has a good potential. Granted, most of the most active participants of the reuse.city lab have significant experience in the field and arguably have not learned much of new. Nonetheless, connecting on a more personal level with people who live in a different part of the world and being able to exchange has its value. In that sense, reuse.city has the potential to become an open network on its own right in the future. There are other collaborative environments in the field with which there is no need to compete, such as the restart network and the many forums dedicated to circular economy and doughnut economy. Precisely discussing wider practices of reuse (not only repair or upcycling) and connecting that to local and regional policymaking, however, seems to be an empty space still.
