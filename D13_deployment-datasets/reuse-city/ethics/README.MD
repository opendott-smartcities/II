# Ethics

As these workshops will help compose a study within an ongoing [PhD research](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott), they need to adhere to Northumbria University's [ethics guidance](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/research/ethics-and-governance/). The study was approved by the University Ethics system on 16.02.2021 under reference number 28431. The application can be found below.

## Title

Technology for Reuse

## Aims and objectives

The project is part of an ongoing PhD research focused on waste prevention in smart cities. It builds on two studies carried out previously which mapped participants’ behaviours towards broken objects, as well as how unwanted materials circulate in society before they are finally discarded. As a result of such activities, the researcher is currently exploring technologies to help the reuse of materials through repair, transformations and upcycling.

The main goal of the study is to understand to what extent the ability to assess the potential value of materials relies on a set of skills which could be augmented and replicated with the use of networked digital technologies. One of its sources of inspiration are the “agents valoristes”, name of a professional role in some regions of France. A [recent advertisement](https://ecossolies.fr/Formation-Agent-valoriste) of formal training for these professionals offered by an organisation in the city of Nantes describes the functions of the valoriste as such:

- To collect, sort and value objects and materials.
- To inform, guide and raise awareness about reuse.
- To work in collaboration with actors involved with the prevention and management of waste.

In order to expand and disseminate the reuse of materials so as to contribute to prevent the generation of waste, the project seeks to understand what types of data, skills and experience are involved in evaluating the potential value of materials. The goal is to envision technologies that replicate and expand on the skills of the agents valoristes. This will be accomplished by a combination of two concept ideas: a multi-layered database of objects and materials (“universal registry of things”); and a machine that identifies objects against the database and displays information about their repairability, spare parts, authorised repair shops, and possibilities for reuse and recycling. Through online workshops, groups of participants with diverse levels of involvement with repair, reuse and waste will be exposed to a prototype of such concept ideas and discuss what their implications might be in real scenarios.

## Research activities

In order to contribute with relevant data and insight to the PhD research, the project will consist of co-design workshops. Participants will be recruited via networks and organisations identified by the researcher, as well as through open calls for participation shared by partners such as the Restart Project; members of the OpenDoTT consortium; Bricolabs network; and other contexts. The expectation is to recruit people with different points of engagement with the study themes:

- Participants with real world experience in repair and reuse, either as professionals, volunteers or amateurs. The aim with this group is to co-design and experiment with ideas for technologies to increase their ability to assess the potential value of materials.
- People experienced in planning and implementing public databases. Here the expectation is to co-design data structures based on open protocols, as well as tools to gather information from different online sources.
- Participants involved with other initiatives of zero waste, circular economy and waste prevention - either on operational level as well as administrative, PR and policy levels. The goal is to understand the implications of such technologies on ecosystem, governance and policy.

The aim of the workshops is then to promote a situated discussion about the relevance, implications, limitations and potentialities of the concept ideas being explored, as follows:

- Speculative prototypes of the concept ideas will be exhibited to participants.
- Participants will be invited to comment on the relevance, feasibility and implications of the prototypes.

The expected outcome is either to co-design with the participants updated versions of the concepts, collect impressions and further comments about the concepts, or to generate new ideas that use technologies to augment society’s ability to reuse a larger volume of materials.
Individual participants with valuable contributions may be invited to particular interviews in order to deepen the discussion.

The workshops will be held online via videoconferencing, primarily via the researcher’s University staff account of MS Teams. On occasion, other encrypted and secure videoconferencing platforms may be used depending on participants’ limitations and conditions of partner organisations or events.

The sessions will be recorded, and later transcribed and anonymised. When explicit consent is given by the participant, video and audio excerpts in which they can be identified may be reused for online documentation and publications.

## Research Data Management planning

For recruitment the names, institutions or affiliations, and emails of participants will be collected. During the workshops video footage of their faces and audio of their voices will be collected via screen recording on the video conferencing platform used. Photographic data may be collected of sketches or other workshop activities. All other data will be text based. All of this data collection will be voluntary and specified in the Informed Consent form.

The [Informed Consent form](consent.pdf) will allow each participant to explicitly choose whether they agree to have their image, video and/or audio made public in a way that is personally identifiable and associated with their real name. Otherwise, all the names will be suppressed by default and the data will be used without any identifiable image, video or audio being made public.

## Storage Details

Raw data (e.g., unprocessed recordings) will be stored on the University approved computer of the researcher which is equipped with sufficient encryption and is password protected. Raw data will remain on that computer only as long as is needed to process in accordance with the consent given by each participant, at which point it will be deleted. All processed data will be stored on the University’s approved online storage service, which is password protected. All data will be stored in accordance with University guidelines and the Data Protection Act (2018). In addition, processed data will be made available under an open license in the University’s Figshare data repository (in accordance with the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and in accordance with Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 813508).

Processed data will be stored on Northumbria’s portal for a period of at least 10 years after the end of the project. However, data published in research articles and on the website (e.g., quotes or photographs) might persist for longer periods.

A [Participant Information sheet](participant-information.pdf) as well as an Informed Consent form will provide contact information should a participant wish to correct or complete information about themselves, contact the University, or learn more about their rights under GDPR.
