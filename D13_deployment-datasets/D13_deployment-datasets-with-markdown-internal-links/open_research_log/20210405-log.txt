## 1. Spreading the word, inviting people, recruiting participants.

 - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6784765362564030464/)
 - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/efeefe/status/1379000173624492034) + mentions
 - Emails to mailing lists (bricolabs, maintainers)
 - Messages on groups (ask community repair, tropixel)
 - Emails to former participants of my research activities
 - Email to groups and organisations working on circular economy, zero waste and similar issues

## 2.

 - Planning next steps
 - Created a new organisation on GitHub, reuse.city. I forked the site repo there, and reconfigured the gitsync. Hopefully it's still working.
