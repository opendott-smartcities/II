I decided the first thing I should to do to start the lab was to ask people to help decide the best way to communicate moving forward. I wanted to make a really short video welcoming participants and subscribers, and letting them know that I would be providing context in the next days leading to the first session this Friday. Recently I've seen some projects using [loom](https://www.loom.com/) to edit short instructional videos, and decided to have a look at it. It is really easy to use, but I felt the need to customise a bit more than it would allow.

So I went back to one software I have installed in the past but never used, [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). It is an amazing tool that allows some level of custom editing over live audiovisual sources, and even to broadcast live to different tools. The result was this [welcome video](https://archive.org/details/reuse-welcome)). I have shared it on my personal accounts on Twitter and Instagram, and this time decided to start from the beginning with independent project profiles on both of those social networks.

In a project call this afternoon we had a short discussion around principles, compromise, achievement and institutional evolution. I believe my decisions at this phase will have an effect in how this project unfolds. And as mentioned in my video, I see it going beyond my own individual PhD goals.

Tomorrow I will find a good and non compromising way to ask participants how to communicate. Sometimes it may look as though I am spending too much energy into discussing minutiae of what tool to use. That is nonetheless an important discussion to have, if my own previous experience is relevant, and I would argue that attention to this is ultimately an act of care with the participants. Some people are extremely conscious of these matters, and that very fine-grained attention brings a mode of perception that I would be happy to include in this project.
