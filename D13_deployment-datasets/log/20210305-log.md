# Log - 05.03.2021

Yesterday I [drafted](../workshops/mozfest/preparation_blog-post.md) and [posted](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/mozfest-2021) an(other) overview of my current status and future plans, starting with the discussion at MozFest next week. It feels like I'm finally opening my research to a wider audience after a weird winter. I shared the post this morning [on twitter](https://twitter.com/efeefe/status/1367789787822911490) and nudged some acquaintances who may be interested in joining the discussion and/or inviting other people.

I'm also spending some time setting up my home-office/workshop and looking for inspiration for the creative parts of my research. Earlier this week I shouted out, also on twitter, asking for references of repair/assistance bots on sci-fi and got some mentions to Star Wars. Curiously, last weekend I finished listening to the audio version of Adam Minter's "Second Hand" and decided to look for him on Youtube. In at least two talks I found, he mentions Star Wars as well. Now I decided to watch the whole saga again (this time over, with my 10-year old daughter).

I'm pasting at the end of this log entry an edited version of the email I sent to my supervisors and project coordinators this morning. One thing worth noting is that I am happy with calling "E-I" the querying part of valudata, an outcome of intense brainstorming in recent days. I have many reasons to like it, as mentioned [here](../../prototyping/naming.md):

> Playing now with the idea of calling the hardware part "Evaluation Interface", or short "EI". "Ei" in Portuguese is a (very) informal way to call someone's attention, akin to "hey!". It could be an interesting way to trigger a voice-operated machine. Thinking an Alexa for repairs. Some languages will also pronounce it similar to the English "I" or "eye". "Eye, is this thing repairable?". I am not 100% sure it will work in German, though, as "Ei"
 means "egg". Unless we decide to go for an oval shape, which could add some fun to it as well.

 After writing that, I started using with an hyphen: "E-I". It's an interesting graphic format in itself. And I haven't found anything particularly offensive or inappropriate in this [juxtaposition of letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EI) (yet). BTW, I had never heard of "[Extreme Ironing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ironing)".

Hi from a bright and chilly Friday in Berlin

Just a quick email to update on my research:

- Mozfest starts next Monday. My discussion will be on Thursday. 21 out of 30 seats are taken, and I didn't start inviting people directly. I'm excited with it. And I have decided not to treat it as one of the workshops to which I have got approval from Northumbria's ethics committee. It would be impractical to stop the session and have everyone click a link to fill a consent form. Depending on the outcomes of the discussion, I may treat it as an external event (which in fact it is), or else chase particular contributions and set up follow-up calls with interesting people. I will also mention the workshops I'll be organising in the future and use my session to recruit participants.

- I had a great first work call with the video producer this week. Unfortunately I won't have anything before next week besides some brainstorming on the speculative part (I get you Jon - on the Consortium Call - about ATM/vending machines, that's one of the scenarios I may play with). I'm having fun exploring manifestations of repair bots and assistants on sci-fi, will likely place some easter eggs here and there in the video.

- I'm also expecting a work proposal from an English artist to explore the form, aesthetics and replicability of the machine - E-I is how I'm calling it since two days, and haven't changed my mind yet.
