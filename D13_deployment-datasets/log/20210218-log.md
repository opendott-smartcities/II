# Log - 18.02.2021

I have just added two new parts to this repository: my plans for the [discussion I will organise during mozfest](../workshops/mozfest), and documentation about my [submission to Northumbria University's ethics committee](../workshops/ethics) regarding the workshops I will conduct for this year's research activities. As I pushed the files to the repository, I felt a little discomfort. Documents that are usually read by a reduced number of people and then kept in a drawer were being made public. That raises a bit of an impostor's syndrome in me. Nothing new, though. I have learned that whilst I can not avoid that feeling, a lot of colleagues feel just the same with their stuff. It is another obstacle that one must overcome in order to build [open projects](https://github.com/opendott-smartcities/working-open).
