Lots going on this week. Looking for ways to develop the physical part of my prototyping, sorting out the due process to commission a video, sketching plans for my session at mozfest and listening to a great audiobook called "Second Hand". On top of all, I'm also brainstorming to find a way to name the whole thing. As I have used "repair diaries" and "repair journey" in my first year of research, I feel it's also useful to have a way to call it all and point people to find more info online. I set up a poll in the OpenDoTT slack asking people's opinion on "Valooe" and the first feedback already turned me off: "loo" in the middle of the name does not sound good. Back to [exploration](../prototyping/naming.md) then.
