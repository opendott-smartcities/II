This PhD research focuses on waste prevention through collective practices of reuse, in the forms of repair, upcycling and re-circulation. It investigates the confluence of initiatives and policies in themes such as zero waste, social innovation, circular economy and the doughnut economy.

The dataset on this folder comprises of data collected through studies and activities, in the shape of interview transcriptions (in formats PDF and ODF), contents of emails sent to participants, as well as particular images of activities, notes and analyses.

The dataset has the following subfolders:

 - "reuse.city": outputs and processual documentation of the online co-design lab conducted with a group of participants involved with initiatives of repair, upcycling and re-circulation of goods and materials.
 - "open_research_log": research journal kept as meta-documentation about this year's activities.
 - "generous_city": ongoing collection of images to be used in a future ethnographic account on the reuse of materials in Berlin.
 - "link-collection": current version of an ongoing collection of bookmarks related to the research themes.

Note: all but one of the participants who signed up to join the "tech for reuse" research study opted in the consent form to have their names identified and contributions attributed to them in the audio transcriptions. The remaining participant had their name removed from transcription files.
