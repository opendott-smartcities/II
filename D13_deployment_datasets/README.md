# 2.4 (D13) Deployment Datasets

> This deliverable is an output of T2.4, which involves the deployment of refined prototypes into real world contexts. The dataset will largely comprise ethnographic fieldnotes, interviews, etc.

This folder contains data generated during the second year of PhD research on Smart Cities within the OpenDoTT project (Open Design of Trusted Things). OpenDoTT is a PhD programme from Northumbria University and the Mozilla Foundation funded by the European Union / Horizon 2020 / Marie Skłodowska-Curie programme.

At the current stage, this PhD research focuses on waste prevention through collective practices of reuse, in the form of repair, upcycling and re-circulation. It investigates the confluence of intiatives and policies in themes such as zero waste, circular economy and doughnut economy.

The data in this folder comes from three main sources:

- [Working open](working-open): documentation generated during the training module on internet health and open leadership provided by the Mozilla Foundation.
- [Open Hardware](open-hardware): technical documentation and code generated during the training module on open hardware and prototyping provided by Officine Innesto.
- [reuse.city](reuse-city): outputs from the online co-design lab conducted with a group of participants.

In order to better understand the field, two Design Research studies were carried out in the first year:

- Repair Journey - seven participants were invited to spend some weeks trying to repair or repurpose broken objects, and were interviewed at the end to discuss what were their challenges and discoveries along the way.

- Ecosystem Mapping - five people whose work is related to the reuse or re-circulation of second-hand goods were interviewed to compose an overview of the field.

This dataset comprises data collected through both these studies, consisting of interviews (in formats PDF and ODF), contents of emails sent to participants, as well as particular images of activities, notes and analyses.

The researcher is available for contact by email: f.fonseca@northumbria.ac.uk


This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 813508.

Documenting the second year of research, looking at (waste prevention in) smart cities.

During the second year of the [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org) project, I am expected to co-create prototypes related to my research on waste prevention in smart cities with participants. A summary of my plans for that can be seen on [this blog post](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/prototyping).

This repository has four subfolders:

- [prototyping](prototyping), where I am documenting the progress of the prototypes themselves;
- [references](references) with URLs, articles and media relevant for this phase of the project;
- [log](log) with meta-documentation about this repository, in tandem with my [research blog](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott);
- [workshops](workshops) documenting the sessions that will constitute my main way of engaging with participants this year.

I keep also a [link collection](https://links.efeefe.me/?searchtags=opendott) since my research started.
