# Universal Registry of Things

Application [submitted](https://pretalx.com/mozfest-2021/talk/review/C3ZJGSQGESN7HLVVWKRXFTAGRUYSLRXL) as proposal to the virtual edition of the Mozilla Festival in 2021. 

## Title

Universal Registry of Things - promoting the reuse of materials and objects in smart cities

## Session type

Discussion - capped (60 minutes)

## Description

The session is planned to be an open discussion about the creation of an open registry of physical objects to support information systems that promote the reuse of materials through repair and repurposing. Some of the issues expected to be discussed are data structure and formats, governance and implications in terms of intellectual property, privacy and security.

## Notes

This proposal is based on the original concept idea documented here:
https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things . It is part of my ongoing PhD research at the OpenDoTT project (Northumbria University / Mozilla Foundation), exploring alternatives for waste prevention in smart cities.

## Why did you choose that (Sustainability) space?

The main goal of the session is to contribute with a research project exploring ways to promote the reuse of materials in urban environments, and particularly what the role of digital technologies can be. It has a direct connection with sustainability as well as the principles of Mozfest.

## Ideas for how to continue the work from your session after Mozfest

The intention to assess the technical feasibility of creating an open registry of physical objects is one among other building blocks of what will hopefully configure a reuse commons. The outcomes of the session will be integrated with other participatory methods adopted by the project.

## How will you deal with varying numbers of participants?

As little as one participant might already bring valuable contributions to the discussion, in which case it would be configured as an unstructured open conversation. On the other hand, if dozens of people show up it will work just as fine. I plan to break the session in 10-15 min blocks that allow to balance between directed discussions and more open interaction.
