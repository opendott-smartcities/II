# Universal Registry of Things

## [Mozilla Festival 2021](https://www.mozillafestival.org/)

11.03.2021, via Zoom. Sign up [here](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/LAUDWV-1) (30 seats only).

I have submitted a [proposal](application.md) to host a workshop during this year's (virtual) edition of MozFest, in the Sustainability space.

**Note:** I am looking for people interested not only in joining the discussion, but also to help organising and documenting the breakout rooms. Please contact me [via email](5wbi948e9@relay.firefox.com) if you are willing to help.

## Context

During my second year of research at the [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org) project, I am [prototyping](../../prototyping) technologies to aid on waste avoidance. My focus is particularly on practices of repair and reuse undertaken on a local/regional level and benefiting local communities. I will work along two main avenues of development:

 - [universal registry of things](../../prototyping/universal-registry), a database consisting of information on how objects and materials to improve their reusability. Examples of information: service manuals, repair shops, spare parts, raw materials and their origins, ideal destination, stories of repair and upcycling, etc.
 - [evaluation interface](../../prototyping/e), hardware and software aimed at identifying physical objects and materials against the universal registry and providing information about their reusability.

I have a tentative name for the system (valudata), and at least one idea for the hardware part (e-i). In the coming months I will be collaborating with a video producer and an artist to evolve the concepts above into more relatable ways to demonstrate them.

## Workshop @MozFest

The idea during MozFest is to explore how best to pursue the development of the universal registry of things. What are the possible sources of information, and what constraints can be expected. Is it possible to scrape data from official sources? How to update, check, build reputation within the database? Is there a place for AI, for instance when merging data from different origins? What are the implications regarding intellectual property and potential judicial dispute? What are the potential governance measures to administer it?

### Expected dynamics

 1. Introduction: OpenDoTT, smart city, waste avoidance. 10 minutes.
 1. Open discussion.
 1. Break-out groups. By theme? Random?
 1. Present results.
 1. Where to next?
