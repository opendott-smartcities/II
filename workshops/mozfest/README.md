# Workshop at [Mozilla Festival 2021](https://www.mozillafestival.org/)

I have submitted a proposal to host a workshop during this year's (virtual) edition of MozFest, under the Sustainability space. It will happen via Zoom on 11.03.2021. The original application can be found [here](https://pretalx.com/mozfest-2021/talk/review/C3ZJGSQGESN7HLVVWKRXFTAGRUYSLRXL) (and a backup copy [here](application.md)).

**Note:** I am looking for people interested not only in joining the discussion, but also helping organise and document the breakout rooms. Please contact me [via email](5wbi948e9@relay.firefox.com) to know more.
