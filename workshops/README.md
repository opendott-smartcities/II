# Workshops

In the first semester of 2021 I will organise workshops with the goal of co-designing my [prototypes](../prototyping). I will use this folder to document the preparation and reflections about the workshops.

More information can be found in these subfolders:

- [Ethics approval](ethics) (Northumbria University)
- My workshop at [MozFest 2021](mozfest)
