An app that allows users to take a picture of any object, match it against the [Universal Registry of Things](../universal-registry-things) and instantly evaluate or learn about its potential for reuse and upcycling.

===

### Description

Functionalities:

* Make/upload picture
 * *server-side computer vision matches against the database)
* Browse by brand or type
* Search

#### Relation to other concept ideas

Point and Reuse is mainly a user/citizen interface for the [Universal Registry of Things](../universal-registry-things).

### Open Questions

* How reliable are the computer vision possibilities?
* Other ways to identify: serial number, RFID, qr code / barcode
* Privacy / security (unintended effects)

### Supporting Research Data

> "So I guess- I don’t know about you guys really, but what I’ve noticed, there is a- For example, the food mixers I work on, these Kenwood Chefs, a lot of them, different variants. To replace those with the modern equivalent would be between £200 and £400. But the repair would be a tenth, roughly, to me, of that purchase. So the old item, it doesn’t matter how old it is, still has value."
