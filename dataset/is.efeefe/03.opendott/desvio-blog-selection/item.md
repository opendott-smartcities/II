*Desvio was an experimental collective I was part of since about 2008 til, probably, 2011 or 2012. It originated from the MetaReciclagem network, but was a little more focused into artistic and critical approaches, possibly in an attempt to move away from the usual categorisation of MetaReciclagem as concerned basically with digital inclusion. It was under Desvio that we started to treat gambiarra as an important aspect of brazilian cultures, and tried to coin a term - gambiologia - that soon enough we found was also the name of another collective, based in Belo Horizonte. We would eventually collaborate with them in projects and texts.*
