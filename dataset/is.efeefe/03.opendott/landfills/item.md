[Estamira](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427221/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (2004)

> Documentary about Estamira, a 63-year-old woman who's been working for over 20 years at a landfill in Rio de Janeiro. Schizophrenic, but very charismatic, she's the leader of a small community of old people living off garbage and has a very lyrical and philosophical attitude towards life.
