About to complete three months since I started [my research](../), I decided to better organise my literature collection. I now have a selection of over 260 documents (papers, books, magazine articles, podcast episodes, blog posts), which are labeled with the following tags:

- circularity
- coop, commons, collective
- critique of the smart city
- database, blockchain
- gambiarra
- grassroots, appropriated, frugal, small, local
- iot
- living labs, hackerspaces
- making, fabrication
- methodology
- non western perspective
- politics
- repair, maintenance, reuse
- sustainability, environment, climate
- things, objects, material, craft
- urbanism
- waste, recycling

Getting ready for a winter of reading as I have never had.
