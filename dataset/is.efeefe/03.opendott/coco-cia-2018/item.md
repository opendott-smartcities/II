*Over the last couple years I was collaborating with Coco e Cia, a co-op in Ubatuba that collects and sorts recyclable materials and drives it to the correct destination. Whatever little support they have in the city was only achieved with a lot of struggle, and they are far from having the ideal work conditions. This video was shot and edited by [Informar Ubatuba](http://informarubatuba.com.br/), a local news website last year, trying to draw attention to their needs.*
