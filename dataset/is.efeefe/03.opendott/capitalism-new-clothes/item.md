Excerpts from [Evgeny Morozov's](http://www.evgenymorozov.com/) 
[review](https://thebaffler.com/latest/capitalisms-new-clothes-morozov) 
of [Shoshana Zuboff's](https://shoshanazuboff.com/) book 
[The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/)

> The Age of Surveillance Capitalism offers a thorough examination of how advertising-supported 
firms have incentives to extract ever more data, harming users, democracy, and much else in the 
process. What Zuboff doesn’t offer is an account of how value—all of it, not just those parts 
accruing to behavioral surplus—is produced in the digital economy. In its absence, Zuboff’s earlier 
assumption about surveillance capitalism being the worst of all possible information capitalisms is 
hard to evaluate, let alone justify.

(...)

> Beyond demanding new rights and laws, Zuboff—a reformist, not a revolutionary—offers little 
by way of a concrete agenda. This policy lacuna might stem from how surveillance capitalism 
and its primary fictious commodity, human experience, are defined. Clearly, no one advocates 
socializing human experience. But if we were to define the fictitious commodity as data, 
sensible political demands, such as those for new kinds of data ownership, become possible. 
In dismissing such demands as merely reinforcing the status quo, Zuboff refers only to plans, 
such as those of the World Economic Forum, to treat data as an asset class. But what about 
proposals for more egalitarian regimes of data ownership, which, transcending private property, 
do not even appear on the corporate radar?

(...)

> Contrary to the expectations of the Italian autonomist theorists—who foresaw the coming of 
emancipatory futuristic feudalism, with its cognitive workers reclaiming the means of 
production while watching capitalists lose their collective grip on value extraction—the 
capitalists did not disappear. They just took a brief sabbatical to invent subtler forms of 
Taylorism. Steve Jobs promised us computers as “bicycles for the mind”; what we got instead 
are assembly lines for the spirit.
> Is it worth remaking these assembly lines into artisanal workshops? In writing of “mutation” 
within “information capitalism” and of a “vaccine” to be applied against surveillance capitalism, 
Zuboff clearly believes that a more humane capitalist alternative is possible. We just need 
to ditch behavioral modification. Would a healthcare system furnished by Apple—expensive but 
data-secure—be better than a healthcare system furnished by Google—free but data-leaky? 
Perhaps. But must we really choose between the two? Or can our institutional imagination chart 
other alternatives?
> The choice between Google and Apple rests on an earlier choice between capitalism and 
non-capitalism, which Zuboff’s Chandlerian gaze does not often register. Since the firm is the 
basic unit of analysis, seeing beyond capitalism is difficult, even if double movements are 
allowed to modify capitalism’s operations. Besides, Zuboff has long reached the conclusions 
that there’s no meaningful zone outside the commodity form. The commodity, as The Support Economy 
argued, is no longer something to fear; “everything that can be commoditized,” it proclaimed, 
“will be commoditized.”

(...)

> Lacking a theory of what institutions and practices ought to lie outside the logic of capitalism, 
Zuboff can only turn to individual rights and consumption. Defined so narrowly, her preferred double 
movement will surely be hijacked by Apple’s Tim Cook. Should we give Apple a pass just because 
its “advocacy” involves an overpriced device which, while offering a modicum of privacy, also 
leads to its inevitable commodification? Do we not care if strong encryption is a universal right 
or a commercial service? Is behavioral modification through monetary imperatives less evil than 
oppression through data-related ones? If so, our problem is with “surveillance dataism,” not 
surveillance capitalism.

(...)

> Zuboff’s Copernican revolution is much easier to explain by its debt to Chandler than Foucault. 
Chandler’s own prescriptions were usually limited to demanding that managers be more responsible. 
Zuboff transcends such defeatism. But her double movement will not win before both managerial 
capitalism and surveillance capitalism are theorized as “capitalism”—a complex set of historical 
and social relationships between capital and labor, the state and the monetary system, the 
metropole and the periphery—and not just as an aggregate of individual firms responding to 
imperatives of technological and social change. That the latter, miniaturized account of competitive 
enterprise is the working definition of “capitalism” in American business schools is no reason 
to impoverish the broader discussion of the system’s rationales and shortcomings.
