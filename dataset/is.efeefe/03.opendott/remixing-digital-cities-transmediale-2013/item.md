Whilst preparing to travel to Berlin next week and participate in [Transmediale 2020](https://2020.transmediale.de/program), I found by chance my [profile page in their website](https://transmediale.de/content/felipe-schmidt-fonseca-0). Curiously, I had totally forgotten of my remote participation in a panel called "Remixing Digital Cities" in the 2013 edition of Transmediale. It had been less than an year since I posted the [last of my blog posts](../../stuff/cidades-coisas-pessoas) (in Portuguese: Cities, Things, People) about cities and technology. The session was documented in video, and can be seen [here](https://transmediale.de/content/presentation-by-felipe-fonseca-remixing-digital-cities) (bear in mind I was home in Ubatuba then and faced some issues with the videoconf platform in the beginning). The discussion is also available, [here](https://transmediale.de/content/discussion-remixing-digital-cities).
