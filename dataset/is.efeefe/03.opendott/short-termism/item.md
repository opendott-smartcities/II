A sad implication of the way cities are structured and managed. While reading Shareable's book [Sharing Cities: Activating the Urban Commons](https://www.shareable.net/sharing-cities/) I found some very interesting examples of initiatives from different parts of the world, and wanted to learn more about them. Whilst the ones managed by NGOs and communities are still available, a considerable proportion of the websites of initiatives led by municipal administrations have vanished. Not only authorities only think about the next elections; they have no respect for keeping an archive of past initiatives either. Shouldn't these URLs be maintained as part of municipal assets?
