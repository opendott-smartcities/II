Just spent some days visiting friends in Madrid. In the neighbourhood we were, waste collections happens during late night. 
Garbage trucks coming and emptying the containers, making a lot of noise. It is inconvenient for light sleepers (as I am), 
but a way to avoid the traffic disruption brought about by trucks circulating during the day in such densely populated area.
