> This paper, more than presenting a case study, introduces the context in which digital and electronic culture, and the ideology that surrounds these cultures in Brazil, were able to influence the programs of the Brazilian Ministry of Culture. We will present the story of a project named Pontos de Cultura (cultural hotspots). We will describe how this project aims to diffuse a collaborative and free thinking/production ideology.
