> Report on digital culture in Brazil, co-authored with Bronac Ferran.

> Locating any art form within a geographical or national border is a challenging task. In the case of digital culture/new media art it is particularly paradoxical to define or confine artists or arts organisations who may be working in virtual and networked ways by physical location. However, paradoxes are often healthy things and certainly, in the case of Brazil, location and context (as well as recent political history) have played an enormous part in determining the specifics of what we will call digital culture. How might therefore we characterize this practice within Brazil in order to begin to map it? What are the key characteristics we will find that may help to differentiate this work from other forms of expression both in Brazil or elsewhere?
