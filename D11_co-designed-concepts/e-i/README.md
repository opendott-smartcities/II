# E-I
## Evaluation interface

E-I is technology (hardware + software) created to increase the ability to reuse materials. Its users show objects to the machine. E-I identifies the objects and displays information about their repairability, spare parts, raw materials, second-hand market, possibilities of upcycling, adaptations and transformations, user stories, etc.

The goal with E-I at this point is not to develop a functional product, but rather to discuss how can digital information technologies help society reuse a larger proportion of materials that are currently discarded, and what would the implications of such technologies be in terms of use, privacy, health and safety, policy and economy.
