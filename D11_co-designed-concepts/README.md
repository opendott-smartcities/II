# 2.2 (D11) Co-Designed IoT Concepts 2

> This deliverable will be an output from T2.2, in which ESRs will continue to co-design concepts from WP1 based on an increasing understanding of the social and technical space. The deliverable will comprise a series of design concepts, co-designed with audiences, illustrated through notes, sketches, videos and low fidelity prototypes.

The meetings and other online activities conducted through the [reuse.city co-design lab](../D13_deployment-datasets/reuse-city) offered the opportunity to update and refine two among the [concept ideas](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts) developed on the first year of research: the [universal registry of things](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things) and the [transformation labs](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/transformation-lab). A third one, the evaluation interface, emerged from iterating discussions over the original concept called [point and reuse](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/point-reuse).
