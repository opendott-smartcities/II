## Workshop during Mozfest 2021

A workshop about the Universal Registry of Things was part of the program for Mozfest 2021. The plan was to engage with participants familiarised with AI and data science to understand the feasibility of the concept. Other goals of the activity were to discuss the meaning of value and its implications in designing information systems, as well as to recruit participants for later stages of research.

See below:

 - Workshop [application](mozfest-application.md) and [overview](mozfest.md)
 - [Preparation blog post](mozfest-preparation_blog-post.md)
 - [Session notes](mozfest-session-notes.md).

Leading that session, as well as attending other activities of Mozfest, was a goood opportunity to rehearse and reflect on what I would develop later in the year, particularly the reuse city online co-design lab. The objective of having a relevant conversation around the idea of value was accomplished. The discussions did not go too deep into technical questions, however the topic of data governance emerged at some points. Finally, some participants signed up for future activities (P.S.: at least two of them took part on reuse.city one  month later).
