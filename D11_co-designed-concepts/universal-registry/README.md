# Universal Registry of Things

## Description

The Universal Registry of Things is a trusted source of information about how to reuse objects and materials. It offers information about repair, customisation and repurposing of virtually any good or material.

## Background

The [original concept for the Universal Registry of Things](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things) was created as an outcome of the first year of activities in the OpenDoTT project.

## Updated concept

The Universal Registry of Things is a dynamic source for information about the value and reusability of goods and materials. It connects constantly to third-party datasources and uses AI to normalise them and make them available through open protocols.

Data for the Universal Registry of Things is provided by manufacturers, associations, repair professionals, community groups, artists and other stakeholders. It comprises of objective specifications, descriptions and links to online resources as well as stories and subjective accounts on the reuse of things. Its deployment and use is promoted by initiatives related to zero waste, circular economy and the right to repair.

### Process

During the second year, the concept evolved based on diverse activities:

 - Conversations with colleagues, supervisors and consortium members;
 - Leading a workshop during Mozfest 2021 ([see below](#Mozfest-2021));
 - Organising and running the reuse-city online co-design lab (see documentation on the [deployment dataset](../../D13_deployment-datasets/reuse-city)).

A prototype of the Universal Registry of Things was developed and called "thingwiki" (see documentation [here](../../D12_documentation-of-prototypes)).

### Mozfest 2021

A workshop about the Universal Registry of Things was part of the program for Mozfest 2021. The plan was to engage with participants familiarised with AI and data science to understand the feasibility of the concept. Other goals of the activity were to discuss the meaning of value and its implications in designing information systems, as well as to recruit participants for later stages of research.

More about the session:

 - Workshop [application](mozfest-application.md) and [overview](mozfest.md)
 - [Preparation blog post](mozfest-preparation_blog-post.md)
 - [Session notes](mozfest-session-notes.md).

Leading that session, as well as attending other activities of Mozfest, was a goood opportunity to rehearse and reflect on what I would develop later in the year, particularly the reuse city online co-design lab. The objective of having a relevant conversation around the idea of value was accomplished. The discussions did not go too deep into technical questions, however the topic of data governance emerged at some points. Finally, some participants signed up for future activities (P.S.: at least two of them took part on reuse.city one  month later).
