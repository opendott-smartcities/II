# 2.2 (D11) Co-Designed IoT Concepts 2

> This deliverable will be an output from T2.2, in which ESRs will continue to co-design concepts from WP1 based on an increasing understanding of the social and technical space. The deliverable will comprise a series of design concepts, co-designed with audiences, illustrated through notes, sketches, videos and low fidelity prototypes.

This folder contains documentation about the updated concept ideas, resulting from experimentation and reflection, as well as discussions with colleagues, supervisors, consortium partners and the audience of conferences and events where the research was presented.

The meetings and other online activities conducted in different occasions including the [reuse.city co-design lab](../D13_deployment-datasets/reuse-city) offered the opportunity to update and refine two of the [concept ideas](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts) developed on the first year of research: the [universal registry of things](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things) and the [transformation labs](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/transformation-lab). A third concept called "evaluation interface" emerged from iterating discussions over the original concept called [point and reuse](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/point-reuse).

## Contents of this folder

- Updated Concepts: slide presentation ([PDF](updated-concepts.pdf)).
- E-I: [concept documentation](e-i) and [video](e-i/E-I_concept.mkv).

The concepts in this folder will continue to evolve following upcoming phases of research. The contents of this folder is a snapshot made in September 2021. Future developments will be documented in the [reuse city wiki](http://wiki.reuse.city).
