Started modelling the [Universal Registry of Things](../prototyping/universal-registry), in order to demonstrate and start playing with it in the upcoming tech training.

Consulting OpenDoTT management/supervisors on dates and deadlines so I can better plan the [workshop sessions](../workshops/lab). For now, I'd like to have an open studio format during a longer time (thinking of four weeks). But I'm open to commentary on that.
