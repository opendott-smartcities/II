It sometimes feels as though I'm hopping too much between different documentation contexts. Decided to make notes here today, as they are a sort of metadocumentation of what I'm doing elsewhere. And it may be that this repository will the main axis of my documentation for this year's activities.

Last week I have registered the domain thingwiki and set up an instance of [wiki.js](https://js.wiki) using heroku. I see this becoming the prototype of the universal registry of things. This morning I decided to create a first [sample entry](https://thingwiki.herokuapp.com/template/samples), of the Unicorn I found in Dundee. I figured working with real objects may bring relevant insight and help me model the database.

I'm also considering the idea of turning my move to a new place next week as a diary study of my own relation with a generous city and what that implies.

On the side, as I read and see references I'm feeling the need to document it in a nonlinear way, as my brain seems to work (no kidding?). So I'm setting up yet another wiki where I hope to start building the structure of my thesis. This time, I'll use the subdomain wiki.reuse.city. reuse.city of course might become the core of my PhD, and I need to refactor everything else to fit that perspective. How does this sound?

*reuse.city: waste prevention and a commons of tools and materials*
