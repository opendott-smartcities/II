Interesting events happening this week - international smart cities, organised by Berlin Citylab; a meetup with circular Berlin leads, and from tomorrow on Moneylab Berlin. Feeling inspired and connected.

Still looking for an easy way to frame and explain my research. Yesterday I decided to register the domain _reuse.city_ and am planning to organise next month's workshops around its making. I'll create a placeholder page on my research blog and start playing with it.

Teste.
