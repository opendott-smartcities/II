# Log - 14.04.2021

More than 24 people (so far) have signed up as participants of the reuse city lab, and another ten or so subscribed to receive updates. It has bene growing organically. Three participants attended the first call last Friday, one yesterday. Today's call is empty, but I'm using the time to refactor the documentation. I am moving a good part of the documents I used to keep on this repository to a [new one](https://github.com/reuse-city/lab/). Over time, I expect to use that one to document everything that may be of interest of the participants and wider public, and use here more as a place for meta-documentation, admin and my personal notes.

I'm not at all happy using MS Teams. Just discovered 2 minutes before my first workshop that I would not be able to record it, for license reasons apparently. Being able to record directly to the University's cloud service was probably my main reason to use Teams over easier alternatives. I might be rethinking that, particularly listening to what the participants would prefer. I worked around using Kazam as a screen recorder, and was very concerned with what the results would be. It mixes the audio from my microphone and the app output in a way that I can not edit, but the result was not that bad. For peace of mind I have recorded the audio on my mobile phone as well, making sure to back up and remove the files afterwards.

On the other hand, after consulting with participants I have created two channels for a more organic communication: a discussion list by email (the most voted option, however nobody has used it yet); and a group on Telegram, already with ten members. I am conscious that interactions happening via Telegram would fall outside the scope of my ethics approval. I believe the same must be true of email discussions. For that reason, I am trying to drive the core discussions to the live sessions, and expect to engage a larger proportion of participants in the coming weeks.

Besides emails, messages and live sessions, I have been experimenting with other ways to interact with participants, subscribers and the wider public. Some of them are:

- [A twitter account](https://twitter.com/reuse_city), not that useful yet but hoping it will become important in the future. Even less useful and quite more confusing from my perspective, I have also created a profile on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reuse.city/). Why? No idea, to be honest.
- Videos - [welcoming participants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2pt18kbZis), [introducing my research focus on waste prevention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMFH11Sxi_M), and hoping to post a new one later today on my design research studies and concept ideas.

As I move the documentation to the new repository, I will probably try to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to organise notes. It looks like a very robust way to organise stuff. Obsidian is not free/open, but I get to control all my data - on markdown plainfile!

I am also using GitHub's kanban-style [Projects](https://github.com/reuse-city/lab/projects/1) feature to keep track of my own tasks. Not sure whether the participants will engage, but it's useful to me already.

This morning (really really early, by the way) I felt like inviting participants to present their work, as I know some of them have already been involved with different projects that may be of interest. I still need to work out how to set up an open call for them, as well as remind them that their presentations will still be under the consent form they have signed.
