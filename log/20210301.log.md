Some reordering in the repository. I'll start calling the whole project "valudata" (just purchased the domain name valudata.org last night). A part of it will be the universal registry of things (for now, I'm not renaming it, but may change my mind). The hardware/software part consisting that will provide an interface (speculative or not) to access the registry will be called "e.valudata", evoking the idea of "evaluating" objects and materials. I decided to stop using the name "valooe" after a member of the OpenDoTT consortium said it the "loo" in the middle of the word sounded bad.

The coming weeks promise to be intense. In ten days I'll have the [mozfest workshop](../workshops/mozfest). 15 our of 30 seats are already taken. I'll hopefully start working in the coming days also on a video demo with a Scottish producer (already registered to the University's procurement system), as well as a prop/mockup of the e.valudata hardware with an English artist/designer. Later on I'll experiment with the internals of the machine as well.

This weekend I finished listening to [Adam Minter](https://linktr.ee/adamminter)'s "[Second Hand - Travels in the New Global Garage Sale](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781635570113)", perhaps the most interesting read for my research so far. It is mainly a journalistic investigation about how second-hand materials circulate in the world, and provides plenty of insights regarding assessment, re-circulation and other aspects. I was impressed by his suggestion of a "waste colonialism" particularly on e-waste.

Other recent reads, (perhaps too) summarised:

- [Kate Raworth](https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/)'s [Doughnut Economics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29214420-doughnut-economics) is a collection of interesting takes around a central point: the way Universities teach Economics is fundamentally a wrong way to address the problems of contemporary economic systems. She suggests economy should aim at thriving, not growing, by way of regenerative and distributive practices.
- [Mariana Mazzucato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Mazzucato)'s "[Entrepreneurial State](https://marianamazzucato.com/books/the-entrepreneurial-state/)" recounts how a great part of contemporary innovations rely on state-funded research (both basic and applied) that are not often portrayed by the cult of private innovators. The book provides a good picture of how much contemporary capitalism is an extractive and unbalanced system in which private operators profit from the investments made by the state, never to return or re-invest them (after all, a great deal of multinational profits end up in [tax havens](https://missingprofits.world/?mc_cid=4b3366d642&mc_eid=e1eaa54a45)). I felt the main argument of the book would fit a shorter piece of writing. On the other hand, I'm looking forward to have a look at Mazzucato's "[The Value of Everything](https://marianamazzucato.com/books/the-value-of-everything)".
