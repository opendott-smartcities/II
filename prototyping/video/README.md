# Video Demo

Partly because of the restrictions due to the pandemic, I am working with a video producer in this phase of research. A video seems to be a good way to summarise my research and translate some of its ideas to a wider audience.

## Call on 03.03.2021

Defining the central aspects of the video:

  1. Situate the scene: a lot of valuable materials are being discarded everyday. Potential wealth is being wasted. Recycling is not the best solution.
  1. Speculative part: workbench bot (where? Artist studio in England? Scrap shop in Dundee?) / mobile app in the streets of Neukölln / kiosk in a warehouse. Valudata.
  1. Link back to city admin / urban planning. What is the relationship?
