# README - Prototyping

For the prototyping phase of my PhD research, I will explore two paths in parallel: the [universal registry of things](universal-registry), building on a [concept idea developed last year](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things); and [e-valudata](e), a machine (or set of different machines) to aid on assessing the potential value of discarded, obsolete or broken materials.

Notes, sketches and reflections about the development of the prototype(s) will be kept under this folder.
