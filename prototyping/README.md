# README - Prototyping

During the second year of the [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org) project, I am expected to create prototypes related to my research on waste prevention in smart cities. A summary of my plans for that can be seen on [this blog post](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/prototyping).

I will explore two paths in parallel: the [universal registry of things](universal-registry), building on a [concept idea developed last year](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things); and [valooe](valooe), one or more machines to aid on assessing the potential value of discarded, obsolete or broken materials.
