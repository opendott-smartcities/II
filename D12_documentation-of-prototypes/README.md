# 2.3 (D12) Documentation of Prototypes

> This deliverable is an output of T2.3, in which ESRs develop refined prototypes suitable for public deployment. Documentation will tale the form of source code, files for digital fabrication, videos, Instructables, etc., as appropriate for the prototype developed.

During the second year of research, the updated [concept ideas](../D11_co-design-concepts) were prototyped in the following forms:

- [E-I](e-i), or "Evaluation Interface".
- [Thingwiki](thingwiki), an implementation of the Universal Registry of Things.
