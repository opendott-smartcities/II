# 2.3 (D12) Documentation of Prototypes

> This deliverable is an output of T2.3, in which ESRs develop refined prototypes suitable for public deployment. Documentation will tale the form of source code, files for digital fabrication, videos, Instructables, etc., as appropriate for the prototype developed.

This folder contains documentation about the prototypes developed during the second year of PhD research focusing on waste prevention and smart cities within the OpenDoTT project.

The prototypes were conceived as trial implementations of two [concept ideas](../D11_co-design-concepts) created in the course of the research. Both concepts discuss the potential uses of technology to promote a greater reuse of discarded objects and materials in cities and regions. The complete documentation can be found on the following folders:

- [E-I](e-i), or "Evaluation Interface".
- [ThingWiki](thingwiki), an implementation of the Universal Registry of Things.
