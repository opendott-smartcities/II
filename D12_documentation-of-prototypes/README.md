# 2.3 (D12) Documentation of Prototypes

> This deliverable is an output of T2.3, in which ESRs develop refined prototypes suitable for public deployment. Documentation will tale the form of source code, files for digital fabrication, videos, Instructables, etc., as appropriate for the prototype developed.


# Prototypes

Prototypes being proposed (feel free to add ideas):

- [universal registry of things](universal-registry/README.md)
- [E-I, evaluation interface](e-i/README.md)
- [transformation labs](transformation-labs/README.md)

See also [this miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lHGsJyQ=/) with an overview of the three prototypes/blueprints.


# README - Prototyping

! Important note: ongoing documentation about the project (now called reuse city lab) has moved to a [separate repository](https://github.com/reuse-city/lab/). In this one I will probably keep [my personal documentation](../log) about the whole process and eventually a couple of documents I consider off-topic for the lab (for instance, my brainstorm to decide how to [name the project](naming.md) and notes about creating a [video](to complement it)).

Original text before I moved documentation out of this repository on 14.04.2021:

~~For the prototyping phase of my PhD research, I am exploring two paths in parallel: the [universal registry of things], building on a [concept idea developed last year](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things); and [e-valudata], a machine (or set of different machines) to aid on assessing the potential value of discarded, obsolete or broken materials.

Notes, sketches and reflections about the development of the prototype(s) will be kept under this folder.~~
