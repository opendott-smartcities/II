This website is a prototype of a concept idea called [Universal Registry of Things](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things) being developed as part of a [PhD research](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott) on waste prevention and smart cities. It seeks to gather and provide information about the potential reuse of second-hand goods and materials.
