Documenting the second year of research, looking at (waste prevention in) smart cities.

During the second year of the [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org) project, I am expected to co-create prototypes related to my research on waste prevention in smart cities with participants. A summary of my plans for that can be seen on [this blog post](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/prototyping).

This repository has four subfolders:

- [prototyping](prototyping), where I am documenting the progress of the prototypes themselves;
- [references](references) with URLs, articles and media relevant for this phase of the project;
- [log](log) with meta-documentation about this repository, in tandem with my [research blog](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott).

I keep also a [link collection](https://links.efeefe.me/?searchtags=opendott) since my research started.
