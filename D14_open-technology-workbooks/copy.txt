# Smart (sustainable, fair, kind, participatory, sovereign, pretty, carbon-positive, future-building, inclusive, resilient…) Cities

Over the last thousands of years, humanity evolved - at least in part - by organising our lives in adaptive systems, some of which are called ‘cities’. It might be fair to say that every city is already smart in that sense. After all, we have applied our capacity to observe and learn, with creativity and ingenuity, in order to overcome the many challenges of sustaining life over generations (along with selective blindness and a lot of luck, one could argue).

Every city manifests itself in multiple layers of flows and containments, commonalities and separation, collaboration and conflict. They are not static in time. In truth they are subject to dynamics of power, culture, global trends, environmental conditions, among other variables. Here again it might be unwise to claim that some cities are adopting “smart” strategies, unlike the others which remain… what? Dumb? Stupid?
Going further on the metaphor, in fact, may provide some elements to discussion. Do we want our cities to be only smart? Shouldn’t we be aiming higher? How about intelligent cities? Or wise cities that beyond seeking only the immediate optimisation of their systems can envision ways for their population to thrive for centuries. Cities of conviviality, of shared abundance. Cities that can heal social division, create beauty and meaning. 

# Shared abundance

Cities are abundant. Products and materials flow from manufacturers and retailers to households, businesses, public services, nonprofits and communities. A considerable part of such goods is then used for some time and eventually discarded. At which point they are expected to be recycled, or disposed of otherwise.
That image however leads to distortions in understanding. The way municipalities and policymakers often try to handle discarded materials tends to see all abundance as excess. If one subtracts usage from excess, the result - whatever is left - is waste.

In recent years, new approaches have been gaining ground that see material flows as complex systems which could be improved by increasing their circularity. In other words, ensuring that the potentiality of materials getting used is not wasted by getting them recycled too early or, even worse, sent to incineration or landfilling.
Such proposals (found in different contexts under titles such as circular economy, zero waste, doughnut economy and others) propose, in line with current scholarship on environment, materials and socio-ecology, that there is a desirable hierarchy of potential solutions for excess materials. Before even thinking of recycling, we should first refuse to buy new products and reduce consumption. When goods are nonetheless needed, there should be an effort to re-use things as much as possible, for they still may have value. And herein lies a central question of my research:
How can we strengthen practices and spaces of care for things that allow society to transform excess materials into collective generosity?

# Assessing vlaue

In the second year of research I set out to learn more about the skills and abilities needed for the re-use of materials. This is central if we want to enable society to increase the proportion of materials diverted from the waste stream. By understanding the potential value of materials and how to realise it, the turn from excess into material generosity will be made possible.
With that objective in mind, I designed a research study to engage with practitioners experienced with community-based initiatives of re-use through repair, upcycling or redistribution. The research questions of said study revolved around the possibility of augmenting and/or replicating value-assessing skills through digital systems - both in software and hardware. In addition, and harkening back to the context of smart cities, I wanted to investigate what kind of facility could improve the proportion of materials reused in cities and regions.

Instead of presenting ideas to participants seeking to collect their opinion, I decided to adopt an approach I called “spiral of openness”. 

The research study would recruit participants to join an online co-design lab for about a month, and involve them to help decide its shape since the onset. Starting from deciding how to communicate, to what the activities would be and how to adapt to diverse timezones.

## A Spiral of Openness

A Spiral of Openness
Research blog entry
"What is 'working open' opposed to? A usual take is to think in terms of binaries, 'open vs proprietary' being a prominent one. But what does that opposition denote? There is a well-documented perspective according to which it is chiefly a matter of 'licensing', or determining the terms in which a given set of digital information will circulate.

(…) What if we think instead of open as open-ended? Not only open as non-proprietary, non-linear, or not enclosed. Doing things without the need to decide previously what their purposes, methods or goals are.”

# Spiral

Instead of a linear study with strictly planned activities, or even a circular one that would always return to the beginning, my research took the shape of a spiral,                  from the centre. At each point in the weeks afterwards, a connection was made back to that origin. Not only participant’s insights and reflections were collected, but the purpose of the study and its format were reshaped. Even the                 of the study and of the prototypes changed - finally to “reuse.city co-design lab”, “E-I” and “ThingWiki”.

# Community building / community being

Participants in four continents joined the calls and online interactions of the reuse.city online co-design lab. As well as providing in-depth feedback and inspiration for the research, the lab was itself the prototype of a community that may still be important in future stages of the project.

# Prototyping

Hands-on experimentation with speculative technologies to address the research questions around augmenting and replicating the ability to assess the potential re-use of objects.

## Hardware/software: E-I

A combination of speculative technologies conceived to help identify and re-use discarded materials.

## Software / data: ThingWiki

An experimental implementation of the Universal Registry of Things. The prototype is a website with information about different object samples. Its data is public and machine-readable.

# Secondment (Berlin is a world!)

I went into the secondment phased moving to Germany as the second year of research began. Even having to adapt my expectations - in the absence of the Mozilla office -, being in Berlin was a good opportunity to get in contact with initiatives both at local as well as at European levels. I have engaged with networking activities, organisations and public events in themes relevant to my research such as zero waste, circular economy, smart cities, platform cooperativism and open technologies.

# The world is a world

The restrictions to mobility imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic were a double-edged sword. For one, I could not travel to participate on conferences and festivals in person. On the other hand, I was able to attend events, give talks, teach and collaborate with projects in different parts of the world, sometimes simultaneously.

Even though it can be argued that the quality of human connections is more superficial in a fully online mode, it may also allow for interesting networked exchange. I tried to make the best use of it. I had for instance the opportunity to present the state of my research and future plans in different contexts.

 - Tales of Care and Repair was a British Council Creative Commission led by Professor Teresa Dillon (UWE Bristol) in partnership with Gambiologia (Brazil) and Toxics Link (India). The goal of the project was to position repair in the context of climate change discussions, by collecting 1000 stories of repair and organising a series of international seminars and workshops in the wake of COP-26 in Glasgow. I helped organise the Brazilian seminar and joined the final seminar in November.
 - A taught a seminar on Open Design in Context to undergraduate students of Design at Northumbria.
 - Professor André Lemos invited me to a talk at LAB404, a centre of digital media, networks and space based in the University of Bahia, Brazil.
