# 2.5 (D14) Open Technology Workbooks

> ESRs will regularly produce collections of written material that document work and present an initial research narrative, which will later be refined and integrated into research papers and thesis chapters. These will be pitched towards a general audience including public, industry and policy.
> The Open Technology  Workbooks will document ESRs progress across the second year of their PhD, including their design iterations, field trials and initial findings."
