# 2.5 (D14) Open Technology Workbooks

> ESRs will regularly produce collections of written material that document work and present an initial research narrative, which will later be refined and integrated into research papers and thesis chapters. These will be pitched towards a general audience including public, industry and policy.
> The Open Technology  Workbooks will document ESRs progress across the second year of their PhD, including their design iterations, field trials and initial findings."

## A spiral of opennness

The Internet Health training module, based on Mozilla's open leadership program, was a powerful start into the second year of research. Technology-inspired open design was not at all a new subject to me. But revisiting it at this point in time gave me the opportunity to reflect on my previous experience working in pretty diverse contexts. That new perspective would prove relevant when it came to designing new research activities for this phase.

> "What does 'working open' oppose to? A usual take is to think in terms of binaries, 'open vs proprietary' being a prominent one. But what does that opposition denote? There is a well-documented perspective according to which it is chiefly a matter of 'licensing', or determining the terms according to which a given set of digital information will circulate. That view, of course, owes a lot to the vocabulary of 'free software' and 'open source', both positioned against 'proprietary software'. If that definition tends to work relatively well to describe how software and its source code are distributed, however, trying to extend it to other realms proved to be tricky at best.
> What if we think instead of open as open-ended? Not only open as non-proprietary, non-linear, or not enclosed. Doing things without the need to decide previously what their purposes, methods or goals are."

## Prototyping

I was already familiar with of prototyping in conceptual terms, and have in the past been involved with a number of projects based on iterative making. However, this was the first occasion that I had to perform a full cycle: from defining the focus of research, to inviting participants to help me understand it deeper and then having the opportunity to create concept ideas and to experiment with concrete expressions of them.

The process was supported by the training modules on open hardware and privacy by design, which brought awareness of the required balance between possibilities and restrictions on technology as well as ethics.

 - Prototyping 1/2: E-I. A combination of speculative technologies conceived to help cities and regions to reuse discarded materials.
 - Prototyping 2/2: ThingWiki. An experimental implementation of the Universal Registry of Things. The prototype is a website with information about different object samples. The data is public and machine-readable.

## reuse.city

The research study reuse.city - online lab was created to co-design updated versions of earlier concept ideas with participants familiar with topics of reuse and repair, coming from diverse localities and backgrounds.

The co-design process was designed to help shape the work on prototypes based on the concept ideas, as well as to discuss what the implications of such prototypes would be in diverse real-world scenarios.

Participants from three continents joined the calls and online interactions. As well as providing in-depth feedback and inspiration for the research, the lab was itself an exercise at community making that may be important in future stages of the project.

## conferences and events

The restrictions to mobility imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic were a double-edged sword. For one, I could not travel to participate on conferences and festivals in person. On the other hand, I was able to attend events in different parts of the world, sometimes simultaneously.

Even though it can be said that the quality of human connections is more superficial in such a context, it may allow for interesting networking opportunities.

## secondment

Even if I had to adapt my expectations for the research period in Berlin in the absence of the Mozilla office, being in Berlin was a good opportunity to engage with initiatives both at local as well as EU level. I have engaged with ongoing network activities, organisations and public events in themes relevant to the research such as zero waste, circular economy, smart cities, platform cooperativism and open technologies.

On another front, the OpenDoTT Studio sessions provided a good way to re-engage with the other research fellows and compensate for the distance. I have co-hosted the first such meeting with a colleague and was glad with the results.

My engagement with common practices of re-circulation of goods in Berlin gave rise to an auto-ethnographic strand of research that will likely be important in developing my thesis.

## cooperation, outreach and teaching

During the course of the second year, I got occasionally involved with activities beyond the reach of my individual research.

Tales of Care and Repair is a British Council Creative Commission led by Professor Teresa Dillon (UWE Bristol) in partnership with Gambiologia (Brazil) and Toxics Link (India). The goal of the project is to position repair in the context of climate change discussions, by collecting 1000 stories of repair and organising a series of international seminars and workshops in the wake of COP-26 in Glasgow. I helped organise the Brazilian seminar and was invited to join the final seminar in November.

ID21 was a study on community-based digital inclusion in Brazil developed by Instituto Neos and supported by the University of Bristol's Impact Acceleration programme. I volunteered to help shape the study and curate the selection of interviewees, as well as to review and comment on the report made by Instituto Neos. The project will unfold into a web-based video game promoting the critical appropriation of digital technologies in communities, as well as an open repository of educational materials on digital policies in Brazil.

I was also invited to present my research to lab404, a centre of digital media, networks and space based in the University of Bahia, Brazil.

Finallly, I ran a seminar to 3rd year students of Design for Industry at Northumbria. My topic was "Open Design Contexts", which brought the opportunity to put in perspective my current explorations as a PhD researcher as well as my past experience in open and commons-based projects.
